# Variables and Data Types in Python

## What is a Variable?

A variable is used to store data so that we can use it later in a program.  
You can think of it as a labeled box that holds a value.

In Python, you do not need to declare the data type. Python detects it automatically.

## Basic Example

```python
name = "Chichi"
age = 16
height = 5.8

print(name)
print(age)
print(height)
